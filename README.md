# Lung-Cancer-Detection-Using-ML
This GitHub repository contains the code for a lung cancer prediction project. The project aims to predict the likelihood of an individual having lung cancer based on various health and lifestyle factors. It utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest classifier, to analyze a curated dataset.
The Random Forest classifier is chosen for its ability to handle complex datasets and provide reliable predictions. 
The project includes preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the data, model training using the Random Forest algorithm, and evaluation of the model's performance metrics. The goal is to contribute to early detection efforts and improve outcomes for individuals at risk of lung cancer.
